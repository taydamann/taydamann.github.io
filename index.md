<p> Hello! I am a second year Ph.D. student of Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis and Research Manager of the Data-Driven Analysis of Peacekeeping Lab. I am investigating the effect of civil warfare on women and civilians. My work considers the gendered nature of war and peace and applies the principles of the U.N. Women, Peace and Security agenda to comparative studies of conflict.  </p>
